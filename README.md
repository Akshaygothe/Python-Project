# Python-Project
This are some of my project using python language. I try to learn python using this simple projects.

# Project 1: Guess The Number
In this project, 
1. User can guess the number.
2. Computer can guess the number.

First, we have to select range in between of numbers. Then we can try few attempts to guess the number using instruction provided by opponent.

# Project 2: Rock Paper Sciessors
In this project,
User is playing Rock Paper Sciessors with computer. At a time they are making their choice of either Rock, Paper, or Sciessors. As, Rock beats sciessor, Sciessor beats Paper and Paper beats Rock. Using this observations result is declared. 

# Project 3: Hangman
In this project,
User have to identify the English word randomly selected by computer. User have 6 attepmts to identify that word. Also, some latters of that word are shown. So, that it will be help for user. If user able to identify that word in 6 attpemts then good. Otherwise, he will loose the game.

Random words are selected by computer is in Words.py file.

# Project 4: TicTacToe
In this project,
I try to create game TicTacToe. User can play with computer, where computer is not geinus. User has much probabity of winning.  

# Project 5: Genius Tic Tac Toe
In this project,
Computer is makeing good moves than random choices. So, its some sort of hard for user player to win. For makeing good moves computer is useing minmax function. Before makeing an moves it is analysing the game using recursive function.

# Project 6: Binary Search
In this project,
I created a list of 10000 numbers using random function. This list is passed to linear search and binary search to search a target number. and time comparison is done using time function. Binary search is best using log n time complexity. Instead of linear search of time complexity of n.

# Project 8: Sudoku Solver
In this project,
We have to pass the sudoku puzzle from command line. And then program of sudoku solver solve that puzzle using recursive calling function and backtracing method.
After solving that puzzle it display the solved version of puzzle. If it is unslovable, or wrong puzzle then it returns False in respect to it is unsolvable. 

# Project 7: Mine Sweepers
This is a command line based game. In which user have to choose a location from ground of size (10 by 10). In some location, there are few bombs planted which are dengerous for game life. So, dig cousicsly. You may loose the game.
